## Hi there üëã I'm Pranav Balaji Balachandran [![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?size=24&color=00FF00&width=600&lines=Automotive+Enthusiast;Building+Future+Autonomous+Transportation+üöó)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

 
Master's student in Autonomous Driving | Mechanical Engineering background | Python & ROS2 enthusiast | AI & Robotics explorer | Movie & Travel Lover

I am currently pursuing master's in Autonomous Driving at Hochschule Coburg and Automobile Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in vehicle dynamics, control systems, and intelligent mobility solutions. Highly motivated to bridge mechanical engineering fundamentals with cutting-edge autonomous driving technologies to create safe, efficient, and intelligent transportation solutions.

I love turning theoretical concepts into working prototypes and documenting them on GitHub.
